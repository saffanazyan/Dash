# Responsive Dashboard Design #1
In this tutorial ([Open in Youtube]()),  I'm going to show you how to use modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a completely responsive admin dashboard with light and dark mode theme functionality. We'll be using CSS Variables, CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, Media queries for our responsive design, and CSS  transitions and animations for some cool animation effects.

## First You Need Install Apache2:
1. Open terminal window, update ubuntu:
```
sudo apt update
```
2. Install Apache:
```
sudo apt install apache2
```  
3. After the installation is complete, start Apache:
```
sudo systemctl start apache2
``` 
4. Enable Apache to start on boot:
```
sudo systemctl enable apache2
``` 
## RUN the code 
1. Type the code in the terminal, open directory ```cd /var/www/```
2. git clone
```sudo git clone ```
4. change the name from Dash to html
```
sudo mv Dash html 
```
